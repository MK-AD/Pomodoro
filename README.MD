# Python Pomodoro App

Simple little python application that will be used as a pomodoro app.  
Actually you can choose between 4 templates (`Tomato`, `Moon`, `Stars` and `Winter-Forrest`).  
_There will be more choosable templates in the future._ 


## Installation

After downloading or cloning the repository, change into the downloaded directory and run

```
pip install .
pip install pillow
```

## Usage
```
Change into the directory and run `py ./main.py`

---------------------------------------

First choose a template from the option-menu at the bottom of the app. 
To start a pomodoro-working unit, click on "START". 
To stop or reset the unit, click on "STOP".

FYI: You can change the template anytime.
``` 

## Announcements
* Nicer start and stop buttons
* Sounds 
* Perhaps a new implementation with Kivy or PyQt5 ;)
